# Admin Dashboard & Accounting Panel

A clean and responsive admin dashboard with accounting module, extracted from the larger project **Global Education Platform UI**. Built with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **jQuery** — fully custom-coded and framework-free.

## 📊 Overview
This is a lightweight subset of the full educational platform, focusing only on the **admin dashboard** and **accounting** pages. It includes modern UI components and is fully responsive for all screen sizes.

The design is based on original Photoshop mockups and has been hand-coded into semantic HTML/CSS/jQuery without using any CSS frameworks.

## 📋 Pages Included
- `dashboard.html` – Main admin dashboard
- `accounting.html` – Financial records and transactions

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Semantic markup and accessibility
- **CSS3** – Responsive layout, animations, Flexbox/Grid
- **jQuery** – Dynamic interactions and DOM manipulation

> ⚠️ Note: This project was originally part of a larger system built in 2018. JavaScript files may need updating to ensure compatibility with modern practices.

عالیه!
شما یک پروژه بزرگ و جامع دارید به نام global-education-platform-ui که یک پلتفرم آموزشی حرفه‌ای است. حالا می‌خوای فقط یک زیربخش از اون رو جدا کنی – و فقط شامل 2 صفحه :

dashboard.html
accounting.html
و مخصوص ادمین/حسابداری باشه.

✅ اسم مناسب برای این مخزن فرعی:


1
admin-dashboard-accounting
🎯 گزینه‌های دیگر:
edu-admin-dashboard
education-accounting-panel
tutor-platform-admin
اما اسم admin-dashboard-accounting ساده، واضح و مشخص می‌کنه که درباره چیه.
